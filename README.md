**Local setup**

`git clone https://github.com/Bahm/Bahm.github.io.git`

**Publishing your changes**

First, check the changes:

`git status`

If you want to add all changes:

`git add .`

Otherwise:

`git add file1.ext file2.ext file3.ext`

Then commit the changes (ideally, you would group changes and commit several times for each push):

`git commit -m "message explaining changes"`

Finally, push the changes to publish them:

`git push`
